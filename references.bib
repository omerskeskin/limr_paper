	abstract = {Multiparty session types (MPST) are a formal specification and verification framework for message-passing protocols without central control: the desired interactions at the scale of the network itself are specified into a session (called global type). Global types are then projected onto local types (one for each participant), which describe the protocol from a local point of view. These local types are used to validate an application through type-checking, monitoring, and code generation. Theory of session types guarantees that local conformance of all participants induces global conformance of the network to the initial global type. This paper provides a very gentle introduction of the simplest version of multiparty session types for readers who are not familiar with session types nor process calculi.},

	abstract = {This paper proves the soundness and completeness, together referred to as preciseness, of the subtyping relation for a synchronous multiparty session calculus. We address preciseness from operational and denotational viewpoints. The operational preciseness has been recently developed with respect to type safety, i.e., the safe replacement of a process of a smaller type in a context where a process of a bigger type is expected. The denotational preciseness is based on the denotation of a type: a mathematical object describing the meaning of the type, in accordance with the denotations of other expressions from the language. The main technical contribution of this paper is a novel proof strategy for the operational completeness of subtyping. We develop the notion of characteristic global type of a session type T, which describes a deadlock-free circular communication protocol involving all participants appearing in T. We prove operational completeness by showing that, if we place a process not conforming to a subtype of T in a context that matches the characteristic global type of T, then we obtain a deadlock. The denotational preciseness is proved as a corollary of the operational preciseness.},

In this paper, we propose a new, generalised MPST theory. Our contribution is fourfold. (1) We demonstrate that a revision of the theoretical foundations of MPST is necessary: classic MPST have a limited subject reduction property, with inherent restrictions that are easily overlooked, and in previous work have led to flawed type safety proofs; our new theory removes such restrictions and fixes such flaws. (2) We contribute a new MPST theory that is less complicated, and yet more general, than the classic one: it does not require global multiparty session types nor binary session type duality — instead, it is grounded on general behavioural type-level properties, and proves type safety of many more protocols and processes. (3) We produce a detailed analysis of type-level properties, showing how, in our new theory, they allow to ensure decidability of type checking, and statically guarantee that processes enjoy, , deadlock-freedom and liveness at run-time. (4) We show how our new theory can integrate type and model checking: type-level properties can be expressed in modal µ-calculus, and verified with well-established tools.},

This chapter presents a particular class of mathematical models for concurrent communicating processes, namely, the class of algebraic calculi. The chapter describes a small language whose constructions reflect simple operational ideas; the meaning of these constructions is presented by means of structured operational semantics. Congruence relation is interpreted as equality of processes. The essence of the congruence is that it is built upon the idea of observing a process, which is taken to mean communicating with it. The idea is that the processes are equal if they are indistinguishable in any experiment based upon observation. Observation equivalence is characterized by a simple modal logic.}

Our calculus also supports a compact representation of the history of processes and types, which facilitates the definition of rollback. Moreover, it implements a fine-tuned strategy for backward computation.

For example, although a server process that has received a request message cannot discard the request, it is allowed to infinitely delegate the request to other processes, causing a livelock. In this paper, we present a type system which guarantees that certain communications will eventually succeed under fair scheduling, regardless of whether processes diverge.

Fair termination is termination under a fairness assumption that disregards those interactions deemed unfair and therefore unrealistic. Fair termination, combined with the usual safety properties ensured within sessions, not only is desirable per se, but it entails livelock freedom and enables a compositional form of static analysis such that the well-typed composition of fairly terminating sessions results in a fairly terminating program.},

abstract = {Multiparty session types (MPST) provide a rigorous foundation for verifying the safety and liveness of concurrent systems. However, existing approaches often force a difficult trade-off: classical, projection-based techniques are compositional but limited in expressiveness, while more recent techniques achieve higher expressiveness by relying on non-compositional, whole-system model checking, which scales poorly. This paper introduces a new approach to MPST that delivers both expressiveness and compositionality, called the synthetic approach. Our key innovation is a type system that verifies each process directly against a global protocol specification, represented as a labelled transition system (LTS) in general, with global types as a special case. This approach uniquely avoids the need for intermediate local types and projection. We demonstrate that our approach, while conceptually simpler, supports a benchmark of challenging protocols that were previously beyond the reach of compositional techniques in the MPST literature. We generalise our type system, showing that it can validate processes against any specification that constitutes a "well-behaved" LTS, supporting protocols not expressible with the standard global type syntax. The entire framework, including all theorems and many examples, has been formalised and mechanised in Agda, and we have developed a prototype implementation as an extension to VS Code.},

However, general methods for expressing and reasoning about various kinds of fairness properties are relatively underdeveloped compared to those for safety properties. This paper proposes FOS (Fair Operational Semantics), a theory capable of expressing arbitrary notions of fairness as an operational semantics and reasoning about these notions of fairness. In addition, FOS enables thread-local reasoning about fairness by providing thread-local simulation relations equipped with separation- logic-style resource algebras. We verify a ticket lock implementation and a client of the ticket lock under weak memory concurrency as an example, which requires reasoning about different notions of fairness including fairness of a scheduler, fairness of the ticket lock implementation, and even fairness of weak memory. The theory of FOS, as well as the examples in the paper, are fully formalized in Coq.},

abstract = {We present TaDA Live, a concurrent separation logic for reasoning compositionally about the termination of blocking fine-grained concurrent programs. The crucial challenge is how to deal with abstract atomic blocking: that is, abstract atomic operations that have blocking behaviour arising from busy-waiting patterns as found in, for example, fine-grained spin locks. Our fundamental innovation is with the design of abstract specifications that capture this blocking behaviour as liveness assumptions on the environment. We design a logic that can reason about the termination of clients that use such operations without breaking their abstraction boundaries, and the correctness of the implementations of the operations with respect to their abstract specifications. We introduce a novel semantic model using layered subjective obligations to express liveness invariants and a proof system that is sound with respect to the model. The subtlety of our specifications and reasoning is illustrated using several case studies.},

They guarantee type soundness and session fidelity for concurrent programs with sophisticated communication protocols. As type soundness proofs for languages with session types are tedious and technically involved, it is rare to see mechanized soundness proofs for these systems.We present an executable intrinsically typed small-step semantics for a realistic functional session type calculus. The calculus includes linearity, recursion, and recursive sessions with subtyping. Asynchronous communication is modeled with an encoding.The semantics is implemented in Agda as an intrinsically typed, interruptible CEK machine. This implementation proves type preservation and a particular notion of progress by construction.},

Besides axioms and inference rules with the usual meaning, a generalized inference system allows coaxioms, which are, intuitively, axioms which can only be applied “at infinite depth” in a proof tree. This notion nicely subsumes standard inference systems and their inductive and coinductive interpretation, while providing more flexibility. Indeed, the classical results on the existence and constructive characterization of least and greatest fixed points can be extended to our generalized framework, interpreting recursive definitions as fixed points which are not necessarily the least, nor the greatest one. This allows formal reasoning in cases where the inductive and coinductive interpretation do not provide the intended meaning, or are mixed together.},

abstract = {A binary session is a private communication channel that connects two processes, each adhering to a protocol description called session type. In this work, we study the first type system that ensures the fair termination of binary sessions. A session fairly terminates if all of the infinite executions admitted by its protocol are deemed unrealistic because they violate certain fairness assumptions. Fair termination entails the eventual completion of all pending input/output actions, including those that depend on the completion of an unbounded number of other actions in possibly different sessions. This form of lock freedom allows us to address a large family of natural communication patterns that fall outside the scope of existing type systems. Our type system is also the first to adopt fair subtyping, a liveness-preserving refinement of the standard subtyping relation for session types that so far has only been studied theoretically. Fair subtyping is surprisingly subtle not only to characterize concisely but also to use appropriately, to the point that the type system must carefully account for all usages of fair subtyping to avoid compromising its liveness-preserving properties.},

abstract = {The technology of mechanized program verification can play a supporting role in many kinds of research projects in computer science, and related tools for formal proof-checking are seeing increasing adoption in mathematics and engineering. This book provides an introduction to the Coq software for writing and checking mathematical proofs. It takes a practical engineering focus throughout, emphasizing techniques that will help users to build, understand, and maintain large Coq developments and minimize the cost of code change over time. Two topics, rarely discussed elsewhere, are covered in detail: effective dependently typed programming (making productive use of a feature at the heart of the Coq system) and construction of domain-specific proof tactics. Almost every subject covered is also relevant to interactive computer theorem proving in general, not just program verification, demonstrated through examples of verified programs applied in many different sorts of formalizations. The book develops a unique automated proof style and applies it throughout; even experienced Coq users may benefit from reading about basic Coq concepts from this novel perspective. The book also offers a library of tactics, or programs that find proofs, designed for use with examples in the book. Readers will acquire the necessary skills to reimplement these tactics in other settings by the end of the book. All of the code appearing in the book is freely available online.}

isbn = {026202649X},
publisher = {The MIT Press},
abstract = {Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties. This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a mature and widely used approach with many applications. Principles of Model Checking offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the field. The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata-based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics, discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena. Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples (most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary, bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and theoretical nature.}

abstract = {Communication is a central elements in software development. As a potential typed foundation for structured communication-centered programming, session types have been studied over the past decade for a wide range of process calculi and programming languages, focusing on binary (two-party) sessions. This work extends the foregoing theories of binary session types to multiparty, asynchronous sessions, which often arise in practical communication-centered applications. Presented as a typed calculus for mobile processes, the theory introduces a new notion of types in which interactions involving multiple peers are directly abstracted as a global scenario. Global types retain the friendly type syntax of binary session types while specifying dependencies and capturing complex causal chains of multiparty asynchronous interactions. A global type plays the role of a shared agreement among communication peers and is used as a basis of efficient type-checking through its projection onto individual peers. The fundamental properties of the session type discipline, such as communication safety, progress, and session fidelity, are established for general n-party asynchronous interactions.},
