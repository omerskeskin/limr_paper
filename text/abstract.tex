We give a typing discipline for a simple synchronous session calculus where local and global types 
are represented equirecursively
using coinductive trees. We then define LTS semantics on our local type contexts. 
Next we define a liveness property for sessions and, using our LTS semantics, prove that this property holds 
for typed sessions. 
We also present a mechanisation of some of the results in the Coq Proof Assistant, 
the most important one being
the soundness of local typing context transitions with respect to global type transitions.
