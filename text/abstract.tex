We mechanise a synchronous multiparty session type framework that guarantees liveness for typed processes.
We type sessions using a context of local types, and use "association" with global types to denote a set of 
well-behaved local type contexts. We give LTS semantics to local contexts and global types and 
prove operational correspondences between the LTSs local context and their associated global types.
We then prove that sessions typed by a local context that's associated with a global type
are live.
